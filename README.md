# Data Analysis Tutorial

This is the source code repository for the Data Analysis Tutorial. The tutorial is intended to be used in a one-day workshop similar to [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/), but for data analysis instead of web development. 

This project arose from a discussion in the Kansas City Women in Technology community. 

## Contributing

The tutorial is licensed under a [_Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal_](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. Everyone is free to contribute. 

Review [Issues](https://github.com/ajander/data-analysis-tutorial/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/ajander/data-analysis-tutorial/discussions) for ideas on what to contribute. 

## How to Contribute

The Github ["fork and pull" model](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) is used to review and accept changes. 

The tutorial is written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

### Prerequisites

To contribute to the tutorial, you will need the following:

* A [Github account](https://github.com/)
* In the case of complex edits, familiarity with [Git command line basics](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) or an [app](https://desktop.github.com/) or [IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) that can be used to push your edits

### Fork the Repository

Start by forking the [data-analysis-tutorial](https://github.com/ajander/data-analysis-tutorial) repo to your personal Github account.

### Edit the Content

For short and simple changes, you can edit the content directly in the github.com page of your fork. Make your changes, save them, and create a pull request as described below.

For new content or complex changes, clone the repo from your Github account to your local computer. Make changes locally and then push them to your remote repo. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git#example-contribute-to-an-existing-repository) is an example of this workflow.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once your changes are in your fork on github.com, you can [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge those changes into the main project. The main project owner(s) can then review your changes, possibly request edits, and then pull your changes into the main project.
